                                Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky:

                    (11 November 1821 – 9 February 1881), sometimes transliterated as Dostoyevsky, was a Russian
                    novelist, short story writer, essayist and journalist. Numerous literary critics regard him as one
                    of the greatest novelists in all of world literature, as many of his works are considered highly
                    influential masterpieces. Dostoevsky's literary works explore the human condition in the troubled
                    political, social, and spiritual atmospheres of 19th-century Russia, and engage with a variety of
                    philosophical and religious themes. His most acclaimed novels include Crime and Punishment (1866),
                    The Idiot (1869), Demons (1872), The Adolescent (1875), and The Brothers Karamazov (1880). His 1864
                    novella Notes from Underground is considered to be one of the first works of existentialist
                    literature.
                    <br><br>
                    Born in Moscow in 1821, Dostoevsky was introduced to literature at an early age through fairy tales
                    and legends, and through books by Russian and foreign authors. His mother died in 1837 when he was
                    15, and around the same time, he left school to enter the Nikolayev Military Engineering Institute.
                    After graduating, he worked as an engineer and briefly enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, translating books
                    to earn extra money. In the mid-1840s he wrote his first novel, Poor Folk, which gained him entry
                    into Saint Petersburg's literary circles. However, he was arrested in 1849 for belonging to a
                    literary group, the Petrashevsky Circle, that discussed banned books critical of Tsarist Russia.
                    Dostoevsky was sentenced to death but the sentence was commuted at the last moment. He spent four
                    years in a Siberian prison camp, followed by six years of compulsory military service in exile. In
                    the following years, Dostoevsky worked as a journalist, publishing and editing several magazines of
                    his own and later A Writer's Diary, a collection of his writings. He began to travel around western
                    Europe and developed a gambling addiction, which led to financial hardship. For a time, he had to
                    beg for money, but he eventually became one of the most widely read and highly regarded Russian
                    writers.

                    (25 June 1903 – 21 January 1950) was a British novelist, poet, essayist,
                    journalist, and critic who wrote under the pen name of George Orwell, a name inspired by his
                    favourite place, the River Orwell.His work is characterised by lucid prose, social criticism,
                    opposition to all totalitarianism (i.e. to both left-wing authoritarian communism and to right-wing
                    fascism), and support of democratic socialism.

                    Orwell is best known for his allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945) and the dystopian novel Nineteen
                    Eighty-Four (1949), although his works also encompass literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and
                    polemical journalism. His non-fiction works, including The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), documenting
                    his experience of working-class life in the industrial north of England, and Homage to Catalonia
                    (1938), an account of his experiences soldiering for the Republican faction of the Spanish Civil War
                    (1936–1939), are as critically respected as his essays on politics, literature, language and
                    culture.

                    Orwell's work remains influential in popular culture and in political culture, and the adjective
                    <q>
                        Orwellian
                    </q>
                    —describing totalitarian and authoritarian social practices—is part of the English
                    language, like many of his neologisms, such as "Big Brother", "Thought Police", "Room 101",
                    "Newspeak", "memory hole", "doublethink", and "thought crime" In 2008, The Times named Orwell
                    the second-greatest British writer since 1945.

                    (German:5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German-born philosopher, political
                    theorist, economist, historian, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. His best-known
                    works are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto (with Friedrich Engels) and his three-volume Das
                    Kapital (1867–1894); the latter employs his critical approach of historical materialism in an
                    analysis of capitalism, in the culmination of his intellectual endeavours. Marx's ideas and their
                    subsequent development, collectively known as Marxism, have had enormous influence on modern
                    intellectual, economic and political history.

                    Born in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia, Marx studied at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Jena,
                    and received a doctorate in philosophy from the latter in 1841. A Young Hegelian, he was influenced
                    by the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and both critiqued and developed Hegel's ideas
                    in works such as The German Ideology (written 1846) and the Grundrisse (written 1857–1858). While in
                    Paris in 1844, Marx wrote his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts and met Engels, who became his
                    closest friend and collaborator. After moving to Brussels in 1845, they were active in the Communist
                    League, and in 1848 wrote The Communist Manifesto, which expresses Marx's ideas and lays out a
                    programme for revolution. Marx was expelled from Belgium and Germany, and in 1849 moved to London,
                    where he wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte (1852) and Das Kapital. From 1864, Marx
                    was involved in the International Workingmen's Association (First International), in which he fought
                    the influence of anarchists led by Mikhail Bakunin. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875),
                    Marx wrote on revolution, the state and the transition to communism. He died stateless in 1883 and
                    was buried in Highgate Cemetery.
